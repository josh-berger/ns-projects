## Project summary

After seeing the best and worst of both the Internet and of cryptocurrency projects, I am more excited about the potential of PKT Cash than I have been about any project or protocol in years.
The objective of this Project is to help the PKT project become more accessible to existing and potential community members by writing a detailed white paper and building a well-designed website where people can gain a deeper understanding of the PKT blockchain and ecosystem. If we are going to reach scale, there needs to be in-depth information on how PKT works and how to use it for people of all technical backgrounds.

I humbly request the support of the Network Stewards so that I can devote my time, talent, connections, mindshare, and reputation to supporting and enabling the PKT Cash community to achieve its visionary ambitions with easily accessible writing and video for people everywhere to join in.

The first step towards broad awareness is a white paper. Once the white paper is completed it will require a website to access it. This Project proposes for me as a domain expert to write the PKT white paper, and to coordinate with a web team to develop a dynamic website for interested parties to access and grasp the inner workings of PKT. With a white paper and website in place, the PKT community can begin to scale to achieve its vision.

### Who am I and Why me?
My name is Alex Lightman and I am a futurist and technologist for almost 40 years. PKT is a unique hybrid of telecommunications protocol, community, and cryptocurrency, and I have unique expertise in thought leadership, invention, marketing, PR, product and service creation, alliance building, community building, business ecosystem development related to IPv6, 4G wireless broadband, Blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

A few bullet points about my relevant background:

* Author of 16 crypto white papers, the kind that not only bring together focused teams, but also keep teams from overpromising and from running afoul of government regulators.

* Keynote speaker at over 40 crypto events around the world, including with Vitalik Buterin at Blockchain Futurist in Toronto, a speech that received global television coverage for five minutes on CNBC.

* Organized and chaired over a dozen IPv6 events that brought together representatives of over 40 national governments, over 40 US federal agencies, and hundreds of corporations, universities, standards bodies and nonprofits.

* In order to get IPv6 mandated by the US federal government, I got the chairman of the Government and Reform Committee to hold hearings on Internet Leadership. I chose the industry panel of expert witnesses and the government panel, testified, and got acceptance by the CTO of the federal government of my package of policy proposals submitted along with my testimony. As far as I know, this is the only time someone has been able to get a technology or telecommunications protocol mandated by the US federal government.

* I’ve won four global awards for leadership and community building of new technology innovations and telecommunications protocols, including the first Economist magazine Reader’s Award on behalf of 4G wireless broadband, after a five month vote open to the entire world, vs. Elon Musk and five other innovators.

* Almost 1,000 appearances on television, including 150 times on Science Channel programs.

I will be working with my colleagues Josh Berger and Jesse Berger. Josh has 10+ years in marketing and web development. He has an international team of developers willing to work for PKT Cash to create a dynamic, designed, and in-depth website to host the content and white paper.

Jesse has 15+ years experience in brand creation and development as well as copywriting. The brands he has created are Radical Studio, including its publishing division and IP comic book studio with over 40 titles with 23 published works, including Hercules, and the feature film Oblivion. Jesse also created Pet Hemp Company and Mantle Networks, to name a few. Jesse has a deep knowledge of the PKT project which will be helpful in crafting communications that will be taken seriously in both crypto and traditional industries.
## Project deliverables
The key deliverable will be the white paper, copywriting, digital assets, branding, and other web deliverables and materials needed to explain the project to average consumers and potential community members. Additionally, the deliverables include a dynamic website to host the content.

### White Paper

* Community Inquiry: I have a list of 54 questions that when answered provide the basis for a complete crypto white paper; one that makes the complex comprehensible, the intangible graspable and the future urgent. Upon receiving notice from the Network Stewards of acceptance of this proposal (or a modified/edited counter proposal that is substantially similar, I will provide the questions to my designated point of contact (POC) at PKT who will get approved answers to the questions.

* Assistance with Questions: Throughout the process, I am available to discuss and clarify the questions and to brainstorm about the answers. However, I endeavour not to “lead the witness” and tell you what I think. My job, as I see it, is to be a neutral “integrating synthesist” who builds a house out the raw materials of the answers to the 54 questions.

* Within 30 calendar days of receiving the 54 approved answers and any relevant supporting materials, I will deliver a first draft white paper. Of the 16 that I have done, half of them were so in tune with client expectations and requirements that there were zero changes requested of me and the first draft was put the work. The others went through one to three rounds of comments until they were finished. Each round took about two to four days on each side for the revisions.

* Congratulations. You now have your completed PKT white paper!

* Powerpoint Deck: I will take the details of the whitepaper and compile them into a deck to use as an evangelist of the project on a global scale.

* Presentation video: Working with Jesse and Josh, I will create a video presentation of the deck to be displayed on the website. This video will help users understand the project and excite them to dig in deeper.

#### Whitepaper Milestones:

**Total time: 81 days**

<br/>

### Website

We wish to build a community-facing website where users can easily access information regarding PKT Cash and adoption. This website will clearly articulate the mission of the project with steps on how to adopt the technology.
Custom design: Jesse and Josh will work with their design team to create a custom website design that clearly articulates the brand and messaging of the PKT community.

* Copywriting: Jesse will extract prose from the white paper and adjust the text to fit within the confines of the site.

* Web development: Josh will work with his development team to take the designs and code them into a functional website.

* Deliver: Josh and Jesse will provide notes to the development of the site and tweak it for delivery.

#### Hosting
Website will be hosted on a dedicated VPS owned by Josh Berger using the pkt.cash domain for the first year with the intent of moving it to a distributed cloud built on the PKT network.

#### Milestones

* Custom designed website (4 weeks)

* Copywriting (2 weeks)

* Designs coded into website (4 weeks)

* Final revisions (2 weeks)

## Project Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### M0 Kickoff

At the kickoff of the project we humbly ask that the network steward grant PKT 20,000,000 to the applicant and the project will begin. This number is larger than usual due to the fact that we are beginning two projects at the same time with fiat cash requirements. PKT10,000,000 will be allocated to the White Paper kickoff and PKT10,000,000 will be allocated to the Website kickoff

### M1 Milestone 1:

Whitepaper v1 delivery grant PKT 5,000,000

### M2 Milestone 2:

Delivery of website design will grant PKT 5,000,000

### M3 Milestone 3:

Completion of white paper edits grant PKT 10,000,000

### M4 Milestone 4:

Turn in video and launch site and grant final payment of 10,015,000

At this point the project will reach the end of it's explicit funding, however the applicant commits to the long term maintenance of the website and the network steward commits to continuing interest in the evolution of the site.

## Legal
The applicant understands that the Network Steward is not a legal entity and no part of this project constitutes any form of legal agreement. The applicant accepts that the Network Steward exists thanks to the efforts of volunteers and the applicant has no reasonable expectation of any action, payment or communication from the Network Steward at any time.

### PKT

### White Paper



&quot;We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men.&quot; – Herman Melville

**Executive Summary**

PKT is a new [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) implementation that facilitates sharing bandwidth, and rewards users for sharing their Internet bandwidth with the network.

- PKT unlocks and optimizes existing network infrastructure by providing compact source routing and end-to-end encryption via cjdns, offers secure routing on networks consisting of mutually distrustful participants, and uses the PacketCrypt protocol to incentivize network participants, create artificial bandwidth demand, and promote R&amp;D in the encryption space.
- PKT&#39;s infrastructure includes carriers and members; PKT as a service includes payments and rewards, a decentralized community, VPN, and mesh networks.
- PKT blockchain provides a mechanism for the tokenization of bandwidth, i.e. PKT is creating a new decentralized bandwidth marketplace where virtual ISPs can buy bandwidth leases from meshnet operators and use those leases to construct virtual networks.

PKT is a fork of Bitcoin with over 90% of the same codebase. However, Bitcoin&#39;s SHA/256 puzzle solving (whose power consumption is eco-unfriendly) is replaced with PacketCrypt – a two-stage, bandwidth-hard proof of work algorithm which can be used for building decentralized VPN services, ISPs, and other services for Web 3.0, and which rewards miners in a native cryptocurrency called PKT Cash.

Combined with a bandwidth marketplace using PKT Cash as currency, PKT will allow users to make money from their bandwidth, while drastically improving the throughput of the Internet by decentralizing it, with privacy-first censorship resistance and smarter, faster routing for a cheaper price. As PKT is based on the Bitcoin protocol, it will be possible to integrate most new developments in the Bitcoin and Lightning Network space.

The fundamental way that the PKT blockchain operates is as - decentralized broadcast network, which is one of its greatest features and differentiators. It is the intent of this broadcast capability to foster truly decentralized marketplaces across various industries and use case application.

By providing an economic incentive to connect bandwidth-enabled hardware to the network, PKT incentivizes everyone to become a prosumer, whether they are a company, an ISP, a government, or an individual. Together, the PKT community will build a high-speed, low-latency, decentralized Internet with more security, more privacy, better service, and the infrastructure required for IoT, edge storage and computing.

Modern life depends on the Internet, making connectivity more critical than ever. More teleworkers, video conferences, and online collaboration, more connected devices, television and radio moving from broadcasting to streaming services, a constantly expanding Internet of Things, services for everything from banking to oracles… the current level of Internet capacity is simply not enough to cope with all the incremental increases as industry, manufacturing, residential, entertainment, and transportation systems go online.

&quot;Broadband providers are laser focused on making sure the innovative networks they built and manage are ready to accommodate a prolonged reliance on telework,&quot; USTelecom&#39;s President and CEO, Jonathan Spalter said in an open letter to Congress.

Despite broadband providers ramping up for a long-term change to teleworking and all the innovative solutions bolted on over the years, the Internet looks much more fragile when an unprecedented number of users connect from home and put unforeseen strain on infrastructure.

The time has come for high-speed next-generation networks and PKT will lead the way by bootstrapping a decentralized bandwidth market governed by the community, which guarantees connectivity for everyone by incentivizing members with PKT Cash.

In fewer than 40 years, the Internet has grown from a specialist tool used by technical experts and enthusiastic amateurs into a basic human right. Most users are willingly pay to connect and let their government and Internet providers control and tax their lives online. Yet most users are unaware that a few large corporations (AT&amp;T, IBM, Level 3, Qwest, Sprint, UUNEY, Cisco, Verizon, and others) provide the routers and cable that make up the Internet backbone. Additionally, ICANN and IETF exist, as hierarchies and governance controlling what, when, and how wetcan access online services, and from where.

Underlying all this, the problem is that the Internet we&#39;re all paying for, in many cases, doesn&#39;t do what we or you need it to do. It&#39;s one of humanity&#39;s greatest achievements, but it&#39;s not built for the 21st century. The Internet is still a fragile construct. It can handle local pressure or even a regional emergency, but its weaknesses are thrown into sharp relief by a national crisis.

The good news is that the current infrastructure is not a constant. Anyone can organize their own Internet; you just need routers, users, and some equipment. The time has come for high-speed next-generation networks and PKT will lead the way by bootstrapping a decentralized bandwidth market governed by the community, which guarantees connectivity for everyone by incentivizing members with PKT Cash. This is the new Internet: an autonomous mesh network free from government control and the disadvantages of the fragile, limited setup you&#39;re using right now.

In this new Internet, users can earn rewards for membership, offsetting their connection costs and selling spare bandwidth back to the network, in the same way homeowners with solar panels sell their excess energy to the grid. Mesh networks and communities like PKT cohabit with traditional Internet providers and Big Tech monopolies, ensuring the best service for each individual user.

You don&#39;t need to be a mesh or crypto enthusiast to join us, Anyone, anywhere can become an Internet prosumer and support PKT. Millions of people will come together to build a new, decentralized Internet earning rewards in PKT Cash and creating a new era of online freedom, secure VPN and connectivity.

**Market Overview**

**Bandwidth and ISP market**

Setting aside ICANN, IETF, and regulators, Internet service providers (ISPs) are the key players in the online world. Most ISPs are traditional Internet infrastructure providers and telecom companies. These large corporations control Internet access through mostly unregulated paid subscriptions and subject customers to censorship and data caps.

We have heard the phrase: &quot;Data is the new oil&quot; in reference to the power that is wielded by the companies that control Internet access. Similarly, the communication network infrastructure is as important to the Internet as physical pipelines are to oil.

In terms of Internet access, all current indicators assume a continuation of the status quo. According to the Global Interconnection Index (GXI), telecoms will become the largest sector in bandwidth interconnectivity by 2021, with 1,886 Tbps. Other sectors with high bandwidth interconnectivity include, cloud and IT services (1,537 Tbps), banking and insurance (1,158 Tbps), and content and digital media (804 Tbps). The GXI estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51% for 2022.

People have accepted traditional Internet monopolies. For many, it is difficult to imagine the Internet without classic ISPs and telecoms. However, the sudden increase in demand on bandwidth due to the shift to teleworking is a new pressure on the global digital economy. In Q1 2020 during imposed stay at home orders, European networks felt increased workloads, with Vodafone detecting a 50% rise in Internet use. The European Commission forced Netflix, YouTube, and Disney to reduce the bitrate of their streams. The GXI estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51% for 2022.

As mentioned above, this tremendous growth of interconnection bandwidth assumes no significant changes in the traditional Internet infrastructure and business approach. Any company that can meet the needs of the market will be essential.

However, the bandwidth market is currently too monopolized and centralized. PKT decentralizes this market further, giving decentralized networks and Internet providers the chance to join the game and change the rules, together with mesh networks, and blockchain enthusiasts.

Last, but not least, the potential societal effects of the COVID-19 epidemic at the start of 2020 cannot be ignored. The sudden increase in demand on bandwidth caused by a massive shift to teleworking may accelerate the anticipated longer-term arrival of the new age of remote work and lifestyle.

European networks felt increased workload during the outbreak, with Vodafone detecting a 50% rise in Internet use and the European Commission forcing Netflix, YouTube, and Disney to reduce the bitrate of their streams.

The global bandwidth market was already growing quickly, with a high CAGR. The after-effects of enforced lockdowns could change perspectives for both workers and employers, turning the expected slow growth of teleworking into an explosion that needs a much faster, more extensive, and more fundamental response that opens a space for the new Internet – a space that traditional bandwidth providers cannot fill, but which the PKT bandwidth market facilitates.

You can find more information on the PKT bandwidth marketplace in the Appendix (Exhibit E).

**VPN**

Loss of privacy leads to loss of freedom. People increasingly care about online privacy, and virtual private networks (VPNs) are an important tool to achive this.

VPNs&#39; usage is also quite widespread - out of 3.17 billion Internet users, as many as one in four people use them for:

- Anonymity
- Resistance to censorship
- Internet access restrictions
- Security of Wi-Fi and devices

Security concerns are particularly important for mobile users using public Wi-Fi, where a VPN protects data from interception and modification. The same concern applies to companies with teleworkers because people working from home are outside the firewalls on their in-office servers. Currently, 41% of Americans have VPN software installed on their work laptop, 800 million Internet users worldwide have an antivirus subscription, and 200 million are expatriates.

Anonymity, restricted access, and censorship affect people differently in different countries. Some of those effects are relatively cosmetic – streaming services being unavailable in certain countries, for instance – but in some countries censorship means human rights violations being ignored, atrocities going unreported, or political opponents being permanently silenced by a despotic regime. Approximately 600 million users worldwide are affected by censorship; VPN can help users go beyond the limitations inflicted by restrictive governments without revealing their identity or putting them at risk.

Overall, PKT addresses a global market of at least 1.5 billion Internet users. As you can see from the chart, this market has grown rapidly from $15 billion in 2016 to $35 billion in 2020. VPN is also an important part of the cybersecurity market which, from a mere $3.5bn in 2004, is predicted to reach over $230bn by 2022.


We estimate that leaders in VPN will be in command of a $45-$50bn industry in 2024; by 2030, we predict that the market will change to such an extent that the VPN provider will cease to be the central player.

You can find more information about PKT VPN acceptance and growth in the Appendix (Exhibit F).

**Mesh projects**

At the edge, projects such as Freifunk, Guifi, and Althea allow individual meshnet enthusiasts to install infrastructure and network administrators to operate said infrastructure.

These alternatives to the traditional Internet have become more popular due to the increasing strain that the wider network faces but, in practice, a device owner can only delegate control of that device to the mesh network in their city. It works only at the local level.

When that local restriction is removed, which PKT&#39;s cjdns protocol facilitates, a competitive market of next-generation virtual ISPs opens up, creating a worldwide, decentralized Internet with a focus on trading bandwidth instead of access.

**The ISPs of the Future**

Looking at startup wireless ISPs like PKT, the market is significantly dependent on each company&#39;s ability to sell bandwidth leases, which represent access for customers. It is relatively easy to develop this business, since demand on established ISPs is constantly growing, but it is likely that margins will be small. It is a physically local role and the expected value of bandwidth leases is more or less known in advance of deployment.

These startup participants constitute the &quot;Uber drivers&quot; of the future Internet, competing with one another to provide the best service to the largest number of customers in order to resell bandwidth into the market. They will be able to increase their profit by acting as bandwidth traders and holding on to some of their leases in hopes of a price increase as customers begin using the service. However, it is expected that the margins in this business, like in crypto mining, will trend towards zero.

**Problem Statement**

Internet access is a basic human right that is essential for freedom. It can give us access to virtually any information we want, connect us, and provide privacy. However, today&#39;s Internet has many issues in its governance and operation.

**Lack of trust and privacy**

Regardless of where they live, Internet users face a lack of privacy. This is why VPN use - essentially a band-aid on the fundamental problem of Internet connection quality, security, and privacy - is growing faster than ever.

The privacy problem extends to almost all the currently available messaging apps and popular Internet services, because their user base attracts both governmental secret services and hackers.

**Lack of competition**

A surprisingly large number of people are unhappy with their options for Internet access. The main reason is the lack of competition in the ISP market: the number of companies grows, but in many areas and regions the Internet is still expensive.

People frequently feel they are either stuck with their current (often unsatisfactory) service or are not sufficiently technologically equipped to understand whether there is anything better on offer.

**Centralization**

Today&#39;s decentralized services must cope with the reality of the global world of Big Tech and government-controlled, centralized Internet. Truly decentralized services (communications, payment systems, VPN and so on) are impossible without a decentralized Internet infrastructure.

**Cryptocurrencies lack real usage**

The history of widely used decentralized tools started with Bitcoin. However, the p2p payment system created by Satoshi Nakamoto is only the first, primitive implementation of decentralization.

Regardless of its designer&#39;s original intent, today&#39;s Bitcoin is only &quot;digital gold&quot;. Despite progress and innovations in the blockchain space over more than a decade, most cryptocurrencies are still just objects for financial speculation.

**Traditional Internet gets overloaded**

The load on the Internet increases every year and not only peaks at expected times, such as holiday periods and for major sporting events, but also whenever the unexpected happens.

Natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina see a major spike in bandwidth demands. A state of emergency such as the COVID-19 epidemic means lockdown and, whether users are working or binge-watching TV series, bandwidth requirements quickly outrun supply.

**Poverty and unemployment**

While extending connectivity to more remote regions can cause a significant and expected jump in online activity, especially in poor countries with high unemployment, the failure of one or more large businesses or an entire industry can catch providers unaware and create a dearth of connectivity.

**Inflexible combination of hardware and protocol**

Given the chance, many people would like to own a part of the Internet rather than being passive consumers. 

However, bundling of control over network hardware infrastructure and routing protocol administration presents a significant problem. It often prevents the efficient development of mesh networks, decentralized Internet, and Web 3.0 apps. This could explain why it is currently impossible to administer a network without owning the relevant hardware infrastructure, and equally impossible to operate the infrastructure without administering the routing protocols which run on top of it.

**Proposed Solutions**

PKT&#39;s overarching solution to all these problems is to build a decentralized, platform optimized for performance, reliability, privacy, and security along with a community that is incentivized to be engaged and provide necessary resources when needed.

**Optimizing infrastructure**

Current routing protocols tie each device to a single ISP. Compact source routing in cjdns removes the restriction of &quot;one router, one operator&quot;, instead it uses compact source routing to tell data packets how to move towards their destination, sending them one step at a time along the route. In practical terms, cjdns means that routers no longer need to store an entire routing table, so hundreds – or even thousands – of ISPs can rent &quot;virtual routers&quot; on the same device, becoming &quot;Virtual ISPs.&quot;

You can read additional information about this technology in the [cjdns White Paper.](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md)

**Decentralized bandwidth marketplace**

The fundamental purpose of PKT is to bootstrap a decentralized bandwidth market which separates two historically combined roles: the Mesh Operator who owns the physical routers, and the Virtual ISP who sells &quot;Internet&quot; (i.e. connectivity) to their customers and cjdns makes this separation possible. Today these two roles are combined by an &quot;infrastructure provider&quot; - a traditional ISP.

![](RackMultipart20200628-4-cxpn0r_html_ac94b1665c71d75f.jpg)

Owners of solar powered rooftops in a variety of countries can both reduce their energy bills AND resell extra power back to the grid

In a similar way PKT gives users the ability to make money from their bandwidth while also helping the Internet run better, with privacy-first censorship resistance and smarter, faster routing for a cheaper price. Billions of prosumers can join the new Internet, become its foundation, and earn rewards for their participation.

The PKT blockchain has been specifically designed to function using Lightning Network for fast settlement micro-transactions in its bandwidth trading marketplace. This means bandwidth leases can be bought and sold in high volume.

**ISP market**

As opposed to the traditional Internet setup, PKT&#39;s network pays its members for bandwidth, opening the role of the Mesh Operator to anyone, from individuals to megacorporations.

PKT guarantees the essential connectivity regardless of the level of Internet bandwidth demand. This is key, especially considering the increasing strain on our current Internet and the current centralization of bandwidth supply.

**Security**

The decentralized bandwidth marketplace is founded on the ideology that networks should be easy to set up, protocols should scale smoothly, and security should be ubiquitous.

Cjdns protects data using the same encryption algorithms as PacketCrypt so that any high performance PacketCrypt implementation is reusable for cjdns encryption. You can find more information about PacketCrypt and PKT&#39;s technical infrastructure in the Appendix.

**PKT Facilitates an open decentrilized VPN market with many providers**

With PKT, anyone can become a VPN provider geeks or tech-savvy early adopters. The ease of setting up as a supplier will give our users access to many VPN providers.

The price of transactions needed to onboard a customer will be minimized, using a variety of PKT advantages, including the fact that it runs on a native blockchain.

PKT Cash is the cryptocurrency used to incentivizing participants of the PKT ecosystem.

To reiterate, PKT Cash benefits include:

- Incentivization for building out Internet infrastructure
- Enabling more savvy users to buy and sell bandwidth leases


PKT is an open-source and community driven project that enables efficient use of relevant decentralized processes.

**Decentralizing competition**

Internet users will clearly benefit from competition in ISP space, and PKT is built to provide a viable alternative. It would benefit the users and might compel ISPs to improve their services , which would also be a win-win outcome.

**Bridging the chasm of technological capability**

PKT bridges the chasm of technological capability which currently exists for anyone who wants to participate in the networking space. This allows increased specialization, broad participation, and gamified competition.

**PKT Overview**

PKT can become the backbone of the new Internet. Our vision is that if you have the technical capability to point an antenna and connect a cable, you should be able to become part of the Internet.

The only reason why Internet access is expensive and still controlled by the Big Tech cable and telephone companies is because setting up an ISP is hard. PKT is designed to lower the bar to becoming an Internet service provider (ISP). Anyone who can run a TOR exit node will be able to run a PKT VPN exit with a similar workflow. Someone who is currently running a VPN business will be able to do this on the side.

Our mission is to scale mesh networks in an incentivized manner, in turn maximizing bandwidth and backhaul to the Internet, while striving to provide security and privacy for Internet users. Our business model and technologies support efficient implementation of mesh networks, which many consider to be critical components in scaling the Internet with respect to speed, connectivity, privacy, and censorship resistance, therefore.

Our main goal is to facilitate the development of a decentralized Internet and we have all essential technical infrastructure for this purpose:

- The cjdns protocol unlocks the underlying infrastructure
- The PacketCrypt algorithm incentivizes buildout of bandwidth and development of fast encryption technology
- Our Network Steward funds development and ensures a thriving ecosystem
- PKT Cash monetizes bandwidth and gives our global audience a compelling reason to participate in the bandwidth marketplace

We intend to capture the mesh market as a protocol technology and a layer one tech for smart routing of censorship-resistant mesh communication.

_&quot;There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.&quot; – Margaret J. Wheatley_

&quot;_I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.&quot; – Mother Teresa_

**Community Overview**

Few consumers and enterprises think of their Internet connection as something they can monetize, and that revelation has been both inspirational and aspirational. Our community would unite engaged users who want to leverage the opportunity to monetize their bandwidth.

PKT already has community members in the USA, Canada, Mexico, France, Greece, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, and Italy. We expect to continue to grow the network globally.

**Community structure**

The PKT project is modeled on open-source projects such as Linux or the[v8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/). Roles include:

- Network Steward team member

Nominated from the beginning of the project with an option to change by election.

- Manager of an open-source project within the pkt-cash Github group

Self-selecting with the Network Steward stepping in if a project is mismanaged.

- Manager of an official communications forum (chat, web forum, etc.)

Self-selecting with the Network Steward&#39;s approval.

- Virtual ISP, VPN provider, Mesh Operator, etc.

Self-selecting, no approval needed, treated as an equal in the community.

- Local outreach coordinator / educator

Self-selecting, Network Steward may issue recommendations.

**Network Steward**

PKT does not have an advisory board. Instead, PKT governance works through the democratically elected Network Steward (NS) – a group with access to a multisignature wallet which requires three out of five signatures in order to make a payment.

The members of the NS group work to improve the value of PKT for the growing community of its users.

By consensus rule, 20% of mined PKT Cash goes to the NS wallet. The other 80% of the coins go to miners. Funds accumulated in the NS wallet must be used within a period of around three months (specifically 129,600 blocks on the PKT blockchain) or are burned, to avoid them piling up.

Anyone can submit a proposal to the NS to create projects that benefit the community and secure a percentage of the NS treasury.

**Audience**

The community&#39;s main target is to bring in mainstream Internet users who are not tech-savvy. That includes people who understand the concept of monetizing their Internet connection but don&#39;t (need to) understand blockchain. Value offered by PKT should also be clear to those who are aware that their ISPs are taking advantage of them by offering poor service, charging high connectivity prices, or both.

PKT exposes a user&#39;s poor Internet connectivity and will drive consumers to change their ISP if the service is sub-par or throttled. This will inspire a movement of people who realize they can be part of the solution - and get paid for it - rather than wait for another centralized company to treat them properly.

Initially, we believe the PKT blockchain will attract networking-based cryptocurrency companies who should prefer to use a chain that serves the core networking-centric purpose of their project or technology offerings. Companies and projects that want to fulfill their mission of supporting decentralized networking can now engage their communities to backhaul the Internet they want to improve. Even Bitcoin operates on centralized network infrastructure using traditional centralized ISPs for connectivity.

PKT aims to become an ecosystem for launching new projects on its platform. We also want to encourage an active mining community. PKT offers a wider range of mining activities because the underlying algorithm – PacketCrypt – needs both announcement miners and block miners.

Announcement mining will suit lower-end, casual miners, who can use less powerful devices such as smartphones or laptops to mine very small amounts of PKT Cash. With an announcement miner built into the wallets, even the smallest device can potentially participate in extending the network and earn coins with which to transact.

As a side note, the professional miners with access to powerful hardware in data centers with access to cheap bandwidth can earn the traditional mining rewards offered by block mining.

Because PacketCrypt requires lots of communication (bandwidth) between miners, all mining takes place in some sort of pool. Solo miners effectively create their own local pool, and crypto service providers can set up their own communal pools easily. Everyone who is ready to support a decentralized Internet and new VPN can join us, but we&#39;d especially like to see:

- Business people who are experienced at creating value and recognizing opportunity in commons-based peer production environments.
- Open-source software developers and people with experience in community mesh networking, both of whom will already have experience with cross-organizational collaboration.
- People with experience in the VPN space.
- People with experience in software-defined networking.
-
- Meshnet enthusiasts.
- Crypto enthusiasts.

More information about PacketCrypt protocol and PKT mining algorithm you can find in Appendix, Exhibit A.

**PKT Cash**

PKT Cash is a coin that users can use for payments for VPN, bandwidth, encryption, and other services in the PKT ecosystem.

Total supply of PKT is finite and fixed at 6 billion, allocated over the course of roughly 63 years. Block payouts are reduced by 10% every 100 days, and the chain has a 60-second block time.

Bitcoin and PKT Cash share many features. They were both born as community projects with initial focus on early adopters. Bitcoin went on to engage libertarians with its promise of a free market, similar to how PKT intends to engage those who resist censorship and feel strongly about free speech.

However, Bitcoin caught the attention of speculators, driving price instability which made it difficult as a medium of exchange. We intend for PKT to grow &quot;out&quot; more than &quot;up&quot;, blossoming into a rich ecosystem where participants make real revenue by providing necessary services.

**Key steps in project development**

PKT achieves two core goals. The first is providing an economic incentive for people to connect their incrementally higher-powered bandwidth-enabled hardware (&quot;nodes&quot;) to the mesh.

The second goal is engaging people in a bandwidth-enabled ecosystem that is powered by a native coin/currency. We believe that, as it becomes easier to bid and buy bandwidth, this competition will drive the cost of bandwidth down and improve service quality.

To achieve these goals, we plan to:

1. Make a cheap Internet sharing device allowing people to earn PKT Cash with their extra bandwidth.
2. Create the decentralized bandwidth marketplace Virtual ISPs who does the technical job of network engineering so that building a mesh network is simple.
3. Begin building high-performance networking hardware which automatically sells its bandwidth in the market.

**Selected sample use cases for PKT**

People can use PKT to build a high-speed, low-latency Internet which is private and decentralized.

Providing the infrastructure for IoT, edge storage, and computing:

- VPN solopreneurs

PKT can help those who want to get into running a VPN but are not earger to overcome relevant frictions, e.g. set up credit card processing (in the same way an Uber driver might not be keen to start and operate their own taxi company).

- Virtual ISPs

PKT can help those who want to launch a global network without sufficient resources to colocate, configure, and maintain hundreds or thousands of routers in cities all over the world.

- Mesh Operator

PKT can help those who want to arrange an alternative to the cable monopoly in their location, but does not possess skills, knowledge and/or resources to do it.

- Instant ISP

PKT can help those who want to start a local wireless ISP in the easiest way possible, the Virtual ISPs role will absolve them of most of the network engineering, as well as the billing and customer support workload.

- Internet Sharing for small businesses and households

PKT can help to start internet sharing operations of a café, hotel, sandwich shop or other small business or household that wants to offer free Wi-Fi but does not have the technical know-how to provide high-quality service, so prefers to set up an Internet sharing device that allows them to use the know-how (including AI algorithms) of the Virtual ISP to make sure their Wi-Fi is optimized for the best possible service quality.

All use cases mentioned above are based on the technical implementation of the PKT blockchain and PacketCrypt. You can find more information about technical implementation of relevant user stories and scenarios in the Appendix.

**Technical Overview**

This is a short summary of the primary elements of the PKT project. You can find significantly more information about these topics in the Appendix and associated documents such as the [cjdns White Paper](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md).

**Roadmap**

We foresee a vibrant ecosystem of incumbent and emerging non-crypto-centric companies leveraging both the PKT blockchain and the PKT network. This will include legacy network operators that want to generate ancillary revenue by contributing unused resources to the PKT network, as well as companies seeking a high-speed, low-latency, low-cost network to drive competition between Internet service providers and cloud infrastructure providers.

As both savvy network operators and ISPs buy and sell bandwidth leases (denominated in PKT Cash) through the PKT network, as well as onboard new connectivity running PacketCrypt, commerce both grows and improves Internet infrastructure at the edge.

The Network Steward has projects scheduled for rollout over the course of 2020, most prominently including the desktop and SPV wallets. With a wallet, new users can be onboarded through various &quot;pumpamentals&quot; including a coin faucet; i.e. download the wallet to earn coins the way Bitcoin users did in the early days. It should also be possible to fire up an announcement miner through the desktop wallet, thereby growing the number of network nodes and encouraging a large community of individual miners.

By the speed of the Internet improving at the edge, and incentivizing edge users (individuals and enterprise) to provide that connectivity in this gig economy, an unprecedented shift in value for edge network architecture and redistribution of wealth will occur.

**Appendix**

**Exhibit A: PacketCrypt Protocol**

The PKT blockchain is based on Bitcoin code, but it has a different mining algorithm called PacketCrypt. PacketCrypt is the world&#39;s first bandwidth-hard proof of work (PoW) algorithm that has a strong correlation to Internet bandwidth.

&quot;Bandwidth-hard&quot; means a miner is mathematically incentivized to share maximum bandwidth in order to increase the probability of earning mining rewards. The PacketCrypt algorithm proves you are expending bandwidth to the network and pays mining rewards in PKT Cash. In the same way Bitcoin requires enormous amounts of electricity to mine, PacketCrypt requires Internet bandwidth to mine.

PacketCrypt also drives bandwidth usage to increase over time as mining difficulty increases. The result is artificial demand for bandwidth, creating a &quot;buyer of last resort&quot; effect to absorb the excess capacity and ensure that infrastructure deployment projects are profitable even before real demand ramps up to meet supply. Additionally, PacketCrypt incentivizes the development of high-speed packet-encryption hardware because parts of the algorithm are designed to mimic the process of encrypting network packets.

PacketCrypt is an algorithm which takes input data (of a block header) and a list of data items where the Merkle root of that list has been committed in the input data. It accesses four items from the list (determinant random based on the items and the input data) and then outputs a hash of the input data and the four items. It also outputs a proof containing the four data items from the list and a partial Merkle tree allowing the verifier to prove that those items existed at the given positions in that list.

Verification of the resulting proof consists of using the partial Merkle tree to build a sparse list with only those four data items and then repeating the process of hashing. If the PacketCrypt algorithm requires a data item which is not present, the verification fails. On success, it results in the same hash which was produced by the original mining algorithm.

When searching for a partial preimage, as is done in cryptocurrency mining, the PacketCrypt algorithm must be run millions of times over. Each time it is run, it must access data items from the list, making the result an effective proof that the data set was present in the miner&#39;s memory at the time that they were mining.

PacketCrypt is segmented into two distinct components which need to send data between themselves - thus using the bandwidth. Though the component which does the sending could be any hardware, it is foreseen that small edge devices will tend to be the announcement miners and this is how they will gain access to small amounts of PKT to transact with.

The block miner is the component which does the receiving of announcements from announcement miners around the world. The block miners are the traditional miners in the blockchain sense - they validate the chain and get the payouts - but since they get a discount on the difficulty of the work they do based on the announcements which they collect, they are incentivized to pay out to the announcement miners.

**Hash algorithms**

PacketCrypt uses the chacha20/poly1305 encryption algorithm to encrypt a 2,048-byte buffer multiple times over, while copying each data item over the first 1,024 of that buffer each cycle. At the end of each cycle, the poly1305 authenticator and part of the encrypted data is the key for the next encryption cycle, as well as for the index of the next data item to access.

While this choice of algorithm is clearly unorthodox, the objective is to encourage the development of technology that works for encrypting and sending messages of about the same size as an Internet packet. Using PoW tied to bandwidth sharing in a rigorously provable manner, ASIC resistance, and promoting the maximization of bandwidth mining over CPU mining, PacketCrypt creates a coin (PKT Cash) to incentivize the growth of mesh networks, externalize the cost of network growth, and form the basis of a bandwidth marketplace.

The algorithm also creates a &quot;useful&quot; PoW, whereby users on home computers or edge devices are not only incentivized and minting new coins, but are also propagating the growth of mesh networks by leveraging pre-existing network infrastructure operated by ISPs. This does not mean that the actual bandwidth users are expending is being &quot;used&quot; by the network. However, by deploying bandwidth resources, users are creating demand for bandwidth, which in turn will drive the cost of bandwidth down. This is similar to the history of cell phone minutes, whereby consumers using more minutes reduced the price of those minutes, sparking the evolution from &quot;pay by the minute&quot; to unlimited use.

Eventual opportunities will include incorporating PacketCrypt into processors, allowing PacketCrypt to operate on countless edge devices including smartphones, televisions, modems, and routers, thus paying users for supporting the growth and fortification of the network.

**Exhibit B: PKT blockchain**

The PKT blockchain achieves two core goals:

1. It provides an economic incentive for people to connect their incrementally higher-powered bandwidth-enabled hardware (&quot;nodes&quot;) to the PKT network. The effect of this bandwidth-enabled hardware connectivity is a distributed network that is powered and operated by edge users (from individuals to enterprises), instead of solely incumbent, centralized ISPs and Fortune 500 companies.

1. It engages users in a bandwidth-enabled ecosystem powered by a native coin/currency. As more edge users and enterprises seek the economic rewards provided by the network, maximizing bandwidth throughput across the network, a new market economy for bandwidth emerges (&quot;decentralized bandwidth marketplace&quot;) that favors the frictionless use of a utility coin to pay for that bandwidth. We believe that as it becomes easier to bid and buy bandwidth, this competition will drive the cost of bandwidth down and improve the quality of service. We refer to this as the rise of a new Internet powered by the people, for the people.

The PKT blockchain has been specifically designed to function using Lightning Network to enable fast settlement micro-transactions for a bandwidth trading marketplace. This means bandwidth leases can be bought and sold in high volume thus fostering a decentralized marketplace for bandwidth.

The PKT blockchain uses PacketCrypt for two-stage mining, producing PKT Cash rewards.

The first stage – announcement mining – hashes messages (aka announcements), which are produced using a slow hash. Essentially, announcement miners are mining their Internet connection and proving to the network that they are providing high-quality bandwidth. Announcement mining is the simplest part of the process and can potentially be performed by any connected device; it is especially suited to users with limited resources, working at the edge, and allows them to participate in the PKT network and generate small amounts of currency with which to transact.

An announcement, by default, is the node&#39;s network state, but can reference any data, such as a trade orders, routing information, news, tweets, video, or photos. The node uploads this data to the network as its PoW.

The second stage – block mining – collects and validates announcements, making sure they meet the minimum work requirements to ensure first-stage miners aren&#39;t cheating. The block miner then attaches the PacketCrypt proof and sends the verified block to the PKT blockchain. In the traditional way, the first verified block to arrive wins attachment to the chain, at which point the block miner is rewarded with PKT Cash. The first-stage miners whose announcements were included in the accepted block are also rewarded.

Second-stage mining is more resource-intensive than mining announcements, so is primarily the domain of users with access to the high-powered hardware and low-cost bandwidth in datacenters.

The entire mining process requires network participants to maximize their bandwidth to earn payouts. In this sense, the blockchain&#39;s PoW acts as a governing rule set proving that a miner is qualified to participate in the block&#39;s payout. Block miners seek to maximize the announcements they collect to gain an advantage in their target work calculations, while announcement miners seek to maximize the number of successful announcements accepted into a block. Both block miners and announcement miners must maximize their bandwidth to achieve optimal mining results, in turn assuring that the network has high throughput longitudinally.

The blockchain&#39;s PoW is provably bandwidth-hard, within constraints, and thus it would not be more efficient to mine with ASICs than with GPUs due to the inherent memory hardness required for achieving bandwidth hardness.

Technical details of the mining algorithms are in Exhibit C, below.

As PKT is based on the Bitcoin protocol, we will tend to integrate new developments in the Bitcoin and Lightning Network space. We will attempt to minimize hard forks, but not with as much zeal as the Bitcoin developers.

1. Forks which change the fundamental vision of the PKT project (e.g. coin supply, issuance rate, or decentralized PoW based mining) are essentially off the table.
2. Forks which fix a discovered flaw or inadequacy in the realization of the vision (e.g. a change to PacketCrypt in order to patch a &quot;trick&quot; that allows mining without significant bandwidth) will be pursued as necessary.
3. Forks which improve the chain and introduce new features (e.g. ability to issue nearly-free tokens using PacketCrypt announcements) will be pursued, but carefully and with attention to the existing community participants so as not to introduce uncertainty.

**Benefits of the PKT blockchain**

An exploitable flaw in most chains is that they operate over a centralized network. All chains, including Bitcoin, are subject to this single point of failure (SPOF). The PKT blockchain, designed to decentralize layer 1 in the Internet stack – infrastructure itself – has a lower probability of succumbing to this SPOF.

Furthermore, all chains will benefit from running on a high-bandwidth, low-latency, privacy-first, decentralized web. In this way, PKT is complementary to other chains.

No other high-throughput chain has a PoW that can maximize bandwidth over time. Thus, PKT is unique.

The fundamental way that the PKT blockchain operates – with announcement miners and block miners creating a broadcast network without direct human control – enables truly decentralized marketplaces. This creates an added value that cannot be understated and is one of the PKT blockchain&#39;s greatest features and differentiators.

The PKT blockchain PoW incentivizes nodes to broadcast packets across the network as a simplistic and valuable underpinning. Since announcements can reference data related to virtually anything, though the announcement data size limit is small, the potential use cases of PKT&#39;s gossip network are robust and wide-reaching.

Examples using this broadcast infrastructure include, but are not limited to:

- settling bandwidth leases
- VPN
- distributed computing
- decentralized exchanges (DeX)
- decentralized Twitter
- video streaming
- chat
- high speed data transfers

**Technical advantages**

We believe a broad range of community members will benefit from a blockchain that features:

- near-zero transaction fees
- reliably high-speed capacity
- privacy and security, using end-to-end encryption through cjdns
- power for unlimited marketplaces, from legacy commodity trading to new ecosystems such as high-volume bandwidth trading
- reduced friction and optimization for high-speed transaction with global customer reach
- network connectivity between peers propagated by the PoW blockchain
- 60-second block time (10 times faster than Bitcoin)
- Microtransactions using Lightning Network
- Colored coins, to compete with ERC-20 tokens
- Smart contracts

**Social and competitive advantages**

The social impact side of the PKT project creates opportunities for both charity and government investment into scaling mesh network infrastructure for unserved and underserved communities.

By creating an economic incentive for enthusiasts to scale infrastructure past the current frontiers of the Internet, new development efforts can be self-sustaining beyond any initial investment on evolving current edge networks. As legacy and emergent communities gain access to high-speed, low-cost Internet, the prospect of further network scalability becomes inevitable. Additionally, the potential for secure and private mesh network functionality in both rural and disaster areas where traditional infrastructure is damaged becomes fundamental for scaling Internet access worldwide.

As new technologies emerge, including low-orbit satellites such as SpaceX&#39;s Starlink and other extra-terrestrial Internet backhauls, PKT intends to present itself at the forefront of terrestrial connectivity solutions through marketing, publicity, and strategic alignment.

The PKT blockchain has many competitive advantages:

- PKT is not a company
- PKT&#39;s technology is open source, to foster a developer community
- Network Steward invests 20% of each mined block into network development
- Network Steward is democratically elected
- Announcement technology fosters decentralized marketplaces, which makes PKT a potential de facto choice for DeX
- The PKT blockchain fosters a mesh network, creating distributed infrastructure
- The network gets faster as it grows and becomes more distributed
- PKT&#39;s roadmap includes smart contracts
- PKT&#39;s blockchain enables a new Internet to emerge that utilizes pre-existing infrastructure
- The PKT project fosters an ecosystem of incumbent and emergent companies and apps that can leverage a high-speed, private, and secure network, while having access to the public Internet

**Exhibit C: Mining algorithm**

The PKT blockchain uses a two-stage proof of work (PoW) called [PacketCrypt](https://github.com/cjdelisle/PacketCrypt), which is based on a [bandwidth-hard function](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/221.pdf) that ensures bandwidth is maximized across the network (see Exhibit B, above, for a simpler overview of the mining process).

PacketCrypt proof of work works by splitting the process of mining into two distinct stages (announcement mining and block mining). The default behavior of nodes in the network is to forward announcements, and announcements contain a payload hash, making them a dual-use entity that can also be used for broadcasting messages across the network.

1. The announcement miner creates a dataset based on a nonce and a recent block hash. This dataset is created using a hash which is believed to be difficult to implement in an ASIC or GPU. After that dataset is created, it is committed by way of a Merkle tree.
2. The Merkle root and a second (range-constrained) nonce are used to search for a &quot;winning hash&quot;. The hashing process requires table lookups of random elements from the dataset.
3. Upon a find, the element plus the Merkle branch proving it to be part of that tree must be sent. This Merkle branch is difficult to communicate without the use of bandwidth, thus making the algorithm effectively bandwidth hard. This 1 KiB communication is known as an announcement.
4. Block miners are incentivised to collect as many valid announcements as possible because they get a discount on the amount of work they must perform to mine a block.
5. To prove that they have the announcements that they say they do, the block miner first commits the Merkle root of their announcements in the coinbase, then begins searching for a winning hash. The hashing process again requires randomly accessing memory, but this time the memory they must access is the announcement set.
6. The hashing process performed by block miners is designed to mimic the process of encrypting a networking data packet, such that any efficient mining hardware or software can be trivially adapted to packet encryption for VPN purposes.
7. Upon finding a winning hash, the miner must prove the Merkle branches to the announcements they accessed during that hash-cycle. This makes it unfeasible for a block miner to pretend to have announcements they don&#39;t actually have.
8. To keep block miners seeking fresh announcements, announcements lose value over time until they are eventually considered invalid by the blockchain and can no longer be used to mine.

**The mining algorithm**

The core mining algorithm of PacketCrypt is a 4-cycle encryption and memory lookup loop over a 2 KiB buffer. Each cycle, a 1 KiB item (announcement) is selected and copied over a portion of the encrypted data before the data is encrypted again.

const zero [16]byte

func PacketCryptCycle(announcements [][1024]byte, seed [32]byte, nonce uint32) [32]byte {

var state [2048]byte

chacha20.XORKeyStream(state, state, zero, seed)

writeUInt32LE(state[0:4], nonce)

CryptoCycle(state)

for i := 0; i \&lt; 4; i++ {

itemNo := readUInt32LE(state[16:20]) % len(announcements)

copy(state[32:1056], announcements[itemNo])

CryptoCycle(state)

}

return concat(state[192:208], state[16:32])

}

**CryptoCycle**

In order to understand how the mining algorithm works and why it makes use of the particular offsets when copying data, it is important to understand exactly what CryptoCycle does.

CryptoCycle is based on an implementation of chacha20/poly1305 as standardized by the IETF in RFC-7539. Effort was made to ensure that building a device for performing CryptoCycle is not significantly easier than building a device which can encrypt Internet packets.

Because encrypting Internet traffic requires being able to encrypt messages of differing lengths with or without associated data, CryptoCycle treats the first 16 bytes of the buffer as a header with certain parameters about the encryption to be performed. The header specifies the length of the content to encrypt and additional data to authenticate as well as a flag to indicate whether the algorithm is in encryption or decryption mode. Decryption is slightly different, with the poly1305 authentication occurring before the chacha20 instead of after.

When attempting to &quot;decrypt&quot; random data with a random key, it&#39;s clear that the authentication check will almost certainly fail, so this algorithm requires the caller to verify the authenticator manually with an inexpensive constant-time memcmp() operation.

**Announcement mining**

Each announcement contains a commitment of the block height (parent\_block\_height) as well as the most recent block hash at the time when the announcement was created. An announcement &quot;matures&quot; and becomes usable for mining a block when the block height is parent\_block\_height + 2 (which gives announcement miners time to mine and block miners time to receive announcements). After this height, the work value of an announcement (for the purposes of minimum\_announcement\_work) is divided by the number of blocks since its maturity.

Announcement mining itself follows a similar pattern to block mining, reusing many of the same algorithmic primitives but with a few special tweaks.

First, as there are no announcements to collect, the miner generates 16,384 1 KiB data elements using RandMemoHash. These items are generated using the hash of the announcement header with the soft\_nonce field blanked.

Secondly, because the verifier can re-generate the 1 KiB data items, the prover need not attach the items for verification, nor even the Merkle branches except for the last item. This helps control the size of the resulting announcement, which must be precisely 1 KiB.

Third, in order to encourage CPU mining and, at the same time, encourage research into advanced CPU designs, the announcement mining process also involves the execution of randomly generated programs.

**Announcement design objectives**

A number of design objectives went into the design of announcements:

- Multi-use

An announcement which is mined for the purpose of broadcasting a message to the network should not be significantly less useful to a block miner than an announcement which was mined for the purpose of helping the block miner mine a block.

- Bandwidth-hardness

The exchange of announcements in order to get a discount on the proof of work necessary to mine a block must be a bandwidth-hard activity. This implies announcements should be difficult to compress and that miners should be incentivised to prefer many announcements over few.

- CPU-favoritism

Announcements are intended not only to serve as proof of work but also to allow communication, so announcement mining is designed to favor commodity hardware such as PCs and phones.

- CPU-evolution

Finally, the announcement mining algorithm is intended to provide a basis for thinking about next generation CPU designs.

**Irreducability**

For the multi-use and the bandwidth-hardness objectives, it is desirable that an announcement miner cannot cause their announcements to be compressible to significantly less than 1 KiB in size. The announcement payload is separated from the 1 KiB announcement itself so that the only parts of the announcement which an announcement miner can really control are the content\_type and content\_hash. A block miner who has no interest in using casually crafted announcements can omit these 40 bytes from the memory locations where they store announcements, but these 40 bytes are about all.

The content of the announcement is the 56-byte header plus a Merkle branch 13 hashes long, and a Merkle root needed to validate the announcement. The Merkle tree used for announcement hashing uses 64-byte Blake2b hashes, which creates a total of 896 bytes of hashes that cannot be omitted without requiring the recipient to regenerate the 16,384 data items used to create the announcement.

The 56-byte header plus the 896-byte Merkle branch and root is 952 bytes, so the final 72 bytes come from the fourth data item. While that fourth data item is probably the easiest thing to recreate, it is only 7% of the announcement data and, while it can be omitted from the data sent by the announcement miner to the block miner, the work required to redo the RandMemoHash cycle for recreating the data is far too much for the miner to omit it from memory.

**Reusability**

With casual and &quot;professional&quot; announcement miners both participating in the network, one might expect the typical minimum\_announcement\_work to skyrocket as professionals generate almost all of the announcements needed for block mining.

This is mitigated by the fact that announcements are reusable for mining multiple blocks - but at a degrading value. So if a block miner receives 100 announcements per block period and they&#39;re worth 100 CPU-units each, they can start out by mining a block with minimum\_announcement\_work of 100. Then, next cycle, they can double the announcement count by halving minimum\_announcement\_work, keeping the same total effort but now being able to also include more casually mined announcements which have a lower amount of work done on them.

**CPU-favoritism**

The announcement mining algorithm uses a couple of tricks to favor CPU mining over GPUs and to frustrate ASIC design efforts. However, the announcement mining algorithm is not designed to use every circuit on current-generation CPUs; instead it is designed to try to match general-purpose computing workloads to encourage research on the next generation of CPUs.

To this end, the announcement mining algorithm creates random programs which must be executed before each encryption cycle. The random programs are generated from the result of the previous cycle, which depend in part on the previous random program.

The programs use a stack of 32-bit elements and an instruction set of about 100 instructions. There are branches (both predictable and unpredictable) and loops.

**Block mining**

The block miner&#39;s job is first to collect or create a set of announcements. They then commit the Merkle root of their set in the coinbase. They also commit the set size and minimum amount of work done on any announcement in that set. Mining consists of performing a sequence of four encryption and memory accesses to announcements in the set. The hash of the work done on the block must be less than the effectiveTarget, where the effectiveTarget is defined as:

target\_for\_work( work\_for\_target(block\_header.nBits)\*\*3 / minimum\_announcement\_work / announcement\_count )

where:

work\_for\_target(t) = 2\*\*256 / (t + 1)

target\_for\_work(w) = (2\*\*256 - w) / w

If this work meets the target specified in the block header, the block is valid and the miner sends a proof containing the 4 announcements which were accessed in the winning cycle as well as the Merkle branches necessary to prove that they were included in the committed hash.

Though this proof is probabilistic only, faking the announcement\_count or otherwise faking the announcements is not better than simply mining a smaller announcement set.

**Exhibit D: PKT technical implementation**

PKT development consists of several stages:

1. Build an MVP which allows:
  1. A person with enough technical skill to run a TOR exit node to run a VPN exit for either:
    1. Friends/family only (invite tokens)
    2. Anyone and get paid PKT Cash for bandwidth leases
  2. A person with enough technical skill to install an app on their phone to set up a VPN client and connect to:
    1. A VPN offered by a friend via an invite token
    2. A VPN offered to the public
  3. A person with the VPN client installed on their phone to additionally:
    1. Send and receive PKT Cash in the app
    2. Mine a small amount of PKT Cash on their phone
    3. Use small amounts of PKT Cash to bid for priority access to the VPN they are connected to (where even the amount they can mine in 5 minutes gives them priority over someone who offers nothing)
2. Evolve the backend to use Lightning Network or similar technology to allow scaling the community while maintaining near-zero transaction cost
3. Evolve the backend such that it allows bandwidth leases to be tokenized and traded over the Lightning Network and then redeemed from the issuing nodes for the underlying bandwidth leases
4. Evolve the frontend to additionally support sharing of one&#39;s Internet connection with neighbors
5. Evolve the cjdns backend to fully support leases and virtual switches (as described in #6)
6. Evolve the frontend to support mesh topologies where one shares their neighbor&#39;s Internet connection with their next neighbor
7. Begin R&amp;D on hardware cjdns forwarding chips in order to improve bandwidth/cost function
8. Develop educational resources to help networking enthusiasts build local mesh networks

**Exhibit E: Bandwidth marketplace**

**B**** andwidth ****hard proof of work**

PacketCrypt is most efficient to mine by miners who collaborate, but that collaboration requires the use of bandwidth between the machines which are mining. In the same way Scrypt is memory hard because efficient mining involves the use of memory, PacketCrypt is bandwidth hard because efficient mining requires communication between miners.

**The concept of decentralized bandwidth handling**

The first actor who will actually engage the project as a &quot;provider&quot; will be the casual VPN provider entering the space by setting up a VPN exit and offering the service in exchange for PKT Cash, possibly using the otherwise-unused resources on a hosted server which they are leasing.

The second actor will be the internet-sharer, who buys a hardware router and uses it to provide an access point to the public. Because people connecting to the access point are forced to use a VPN (of their choice), they are protected from the sharer and the sharer is protected from legal liability. The effect of the bandwidth market is that the sharer gets some PKT Cash which will help them pay for VPN access.

The third actor is the meshnet enthusiast who is unhappy with available Internet services, or lives in an area with little to no service, and either wants to organize with the community to take the problem into their own hands or dreams of becoming a professional ISP. The big value of the bandwidth market (even as opposed to other solutions which use crypto to settle bandwidth costs) is that the meshnet enthusiast will be able to set up network links and then sell leases for bandwidth over those links into the market. They thus quickly recoup their up-front hardware costs and can expand into other areas more quickly.

The fourth actor will be the manager of an [autonomous system](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/352/notes/autonomous_systems.html) (AS). They will first be attracted by the idea of the efficient cjdns compact source routing which reduces the cost of packet forwarding hardware. Combining this with support for industry standard SDN controller software, there begins to be a business case for migrating an AS&#39;s internal network to the cjdns-based network. After a successful migration, the bandwidth market will be something that an AS will be able to experiment with at their leisure, both participating as a seller and a buyer of bandwidth.

The fifth actor, but by no means the last to enter, is the Virtual ISP. For the Virtual ISP, the value of the bandwidth market is that it allows them to focus purely on network design without having to own or operate any hardware at all. The network operator is partially a trading desk and partially an ISP: they get data from point A to point B entirely over leased links and they provide the helpdesk for their customers.

**Bandwidth market protocol**

The bandwidth market protocol implementation will be roughly as follows:

There will be three main components of the network:

1. The node (this will be the device which offers the actual bandwidth lease)
2. The route server - this is the &quot;SDN control server&quot; operated by the network operator
3. The payment node (Lightning Network) - a central hub for forwarding of micro-payments

On the cjdns node there will be 2 types of resources which will be available for lease:

1. The bandwidth lease - a number of kbps of guaranteed bandwidth over a timespan
2. The virtual switch - an accounting resource needed in order to knit together bandwidth leases into a virtual network

The interactions between these components will look as follows:

1. Every cjdns router is associated with one route server.
2. An infrastructure provider will establish a network link and offer a bandwidth lease on that link. The representation of that lease will be in the form of a token or colored coin, which can be exchanged through Lightning Network transactions.
3. cjdns will periodically broadcast information about the link state of that link to the associated route server.
4. The route server will forward that link state information to other interested route servers.
5. By using the link state information, traders will make informed decisions about whether they want to buy leases and at what price.
6. Upon purchase of a lease, the owner will demonstrate ownership to the cjdns node, which will allow them to sign messages which configure that lease.
7. A network operator owning leases on two or more links into and out of a cjdns node, plus a lease on a virtual switch, will be able to connect those resources together, making a virtual network.

All packets will additionally contain a priority field, serving the dual purposes of allowing a virtual network operator to distinguish between priority of different types of traffic in their own virtual network, and allowing the physical cjdns node to distinguish between the traffic of different leases.

In order to protect a virtual network when a customer of that network is sending more traffic than their lease allows, the cjdns node will dynamically reduce the priority of traffic coming in on that lease in order that the exponential moving average of priority flowing over that link is 1/(actual\_bandwidth - leased\_bandwidth).

Importantly to this design, the failure mode is to fail open. cjdns packets all have their exact path specified in the header and since that path might specify a link for which the sender has no lease, the node will set its priority to zero (free tier) rather than dropping it, and packets will only be dropped when there is link contention.

**Exhibit F: PKT VPN acceptance and growth**

Anyone who can run a TOR exit node will be able to run a PKT VPN exit with a similar workflow. Someone who is currently running a VPN business will be able to do this on the side.

Once we open the VPN market, we will need evangelism in order to bring the idea of future Internet to the people and excite them about an Internet which they are co-owners.

As time goes on, we will need to engage hardware makers (such as Ubiquiti or Alfa) in order to produce wireless hardware devices capable of efficiently encrypting packets, in order to make available a kit for small businesses, home Internet sharers, and startup wireless ISPs.

Finally, we will need educators to help teach and gamify the process of building local networks so that there is plenty of supply feeding the bandwidth market and bringing access to more customers every day.

**Exhibit G: Network Steward**

The Network Steward team are advisors and stewards who take their responsibility to the PKT blockchain very seriously.

From the PKT perspective, projects are proposed via the ns-projects github repository. The Network Steward funds those project proposals it perceives as being best for the long-term future of the PKT blockchain. Decision-making is performed through github for a transparent history of decisions.

As far as the exact use of funds is concerned, that is up to the individual project applicants. Applicants are measured against one another in the eyes of the Network Steward, who is, in turn, measured by the community who could use a PoS vote to replace them.

The Network Steward is designed to fund the growth of the network and thus can pay salaries to developers who contribute on a project-by-project basis. We also want to encourage companies to incorporate PKT Cash, PacketCrypt, and PKT blockchain into their businesses and intend to nurture a community around this vision.

All proposals to the Network Steward are visible and transparent on the PKT github: [https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects). PKT will also be launching a website to track both the progress and roadmap for the project.

[1](#sdfootnote1anc) Technically this is done by utilizingcjdns compact source routing, which enables one router to be connected to different ISPs. Current routing protocols tie each device to a single ISP. Compact source routing in cjdns removes the restriction of &quot;one router, one operator&quot;, instead it uses compact source routing to tell data packets how to move towards their destination, sending them one step at a time along the route. In practical terms, cjdns means that routers no longer need to store an entire routing table, so hundreds – or even thousands – of ISPs can rent &quot;virtual routers&quot; on the same device, becoming &quot;Virtual ISPs.&quot;

[10](#sdfootnote10anc) The Lightning Network is a &quot;layer 2&quot; payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency (like bitcoin). It is supposed to enable fast transactions among participating nodes and has been proposed as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds Lightning Network implementation also simplifies atomic swaps.

Normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant base blockchain (layer 1), followed by making any number of Lightning Network transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel&#39;s funds without broadcasting those to the blockchain, optionally followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the settlement transaction to distribute the channel&#39;s funds
